      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Effective date: January 4, 2026</p>

      <p>
        Welcome to Finverra. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
        disclose, and protect information when you use our website and financial
        calculator tools.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        - <strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not require you to create
        an account for most calculators. If you choose to contact us, we may
        collect the name and email you provide. -
        <strong>Usage Data:</strong> We automatically collect non-identifying
        information about how the site is accessed and used (e.g., pages
        visited, time on page, device and browser type, IP address, and
        anonymized analytics data). -
        <strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong> We may use cookies or
        local storage to save simple preferences (e.g., theme or last-used
        calculator). You can disable cookies in your browser, but some features
        may not work as intended.
      </p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>
        We use information to: operate and improve the website, respond to
        inquiries, analyze usage to enhance features, and comply with legal
        obligations. We do not sell personal information to third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        We may use third-party services (such as analytics providers or hosting)
        that collect and process data on our behalf. These providers have their
        own privacy policies and we recommend reviewing them.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the
        purposes described in this policy or as required by law. Usage and
        analytics data may be retained in aggregated or anonymized form.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement reasonable administrative and technical safeguards designed
        to protect information. However, no system is completely secure — we
        cannot guarantee absolute security of information transmitted to or from
        the website.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Children</h2>
      <p>
        Our services are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly
        collect personal information from children under applicable age
        thresholds. If you believe we have collected such information, please
        contact us and we will take steps to remove it.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct,
        delete, or export your personal data. To exercise these rights, contact
        us using the details below.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Disclaimer & Limitation</h2>
      <p>
        The information provided by Finverra is for informational purposes only
        and does not constitute financial, investment, tax, or legal advice. We
        are not responsible for any decisions you make based on the site. We

        consequential, or other damages or losses you may incur from using our

        We may update this policy from time to time. The "Effective date" at the
        top indicates when the policy was last revised. Continued use after
        changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
